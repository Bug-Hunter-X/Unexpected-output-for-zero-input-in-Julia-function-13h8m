# Julia Function Zero Input Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Julia function related to the handling of zero input. The function `myfunction` calculates the square of positive numbers and the negation of negative numbers. However, it does not explicitly define its behavior for zero input, resulting in unexpected output.

## Bug Description

The `myfunction` function returns the square of a positive number or the negation of a negative number. The problem occurs when the input `x` is equal to zero.  The function implicitly returns 0, which might be unexpected if the user assumes that the function should produce an error or a specific value for zero input.

## Solution

The solution explicitly handles the case where `x` is zero by adding a specific return value or throwing an error. 

The solution provided in `bugSolution.jl` addresses this issue by explicitly checking for x = 0.
