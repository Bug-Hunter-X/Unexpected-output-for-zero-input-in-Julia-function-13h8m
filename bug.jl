```julia
function myfunction(x)
  if x > 0
    return x^2
  else
    return -x
  end
end

x = -5
y = myfunction(x)
println(y) # Output: 5

x = 5
y = myfunction(x)
println(y) # Output: 25

#The bug is that when x=0, the function will not produce an error, instead, it will return 0.
#This might be unexpected if the user was not aware that the function was not explicitly defined for x=0
